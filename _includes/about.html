<section><div id="about"><h4>Pound it <i class="fa fa-hand-rock-o"></i></h4><p>Hello! My name is Adam Recvlohe (rek-low) and I love learning. I love learning so much I taught myself how to code. In the process I learned to build <span>dynamic web applications</span> and <span>static web sites</span>. My work history certainly shows my support for diversity and the importance of education. Now I work to bring together my esoteric career into one coherent whole, using all facets of my eclectic life.</p></div></section>
